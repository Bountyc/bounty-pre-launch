						Ever had to break your head for hours on end in order to write just a few lines of code? Maybe it was working with some API like Youtube's, or trying to get some annoying bug fixed.</br>
						On Bounty, we aim to solve that frustration. You can post your problem on Bounty with a price you put on it- you're saying that anyone who solves this problem, gets $X (the bounty!). Anyone on the website can then proceed to attempt to solve it, and if he succeeds, you get the code, and he get's the bounty. It's a quick and easy way to get things solved for you. As developers, our time is valuable, and if we can save a few hours of work, it's definitely worth a few dollars. </br>
						On the other side of it, it's a really easy and fun way to make money for experienced developers. You can go through website solving questions and problems people have, making money from each problem you solve.
						<!--On Bounty, any user can post a question/small task with money on it. This question with the money is called a "bounty". Any user on the site can then answer the bounty and get the money from it. Bounty is an awesome way to get really quick answers to questions you have, and a fun and easy way for experienced developers to make money. -->
